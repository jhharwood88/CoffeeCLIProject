# CoffeeScraper

For my Ruby project I created a scraper application to scrape the main drink menu, and subsequent sub menus from the Starbucks website

## Installation

To install this application fork and clone this repo locally, run bundle install in console to install gem dependencies. Finally call ./bin/coffee-scraper to start the CLI application.

## Usage

This application is intended to scrape and display drink information from the Starbucks website
